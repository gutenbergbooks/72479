<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

</div>

<p>As the pronunciation of words is determined by the usage
of the best speakers, so, in a great measure, the punctuation
of sentences is based on the usage of the best writers. Recognizing
this fact, the author has aimed,—</p>

<p>1. To state such general rules as are recognized by most
writers of good English.</p>

<p>2. To illustrate these rules by examples taken from many
of our best English classics.</p>

<p>3. To give some of the differences in usage that exist even
among the best of writers.</p>

<p>It is frequently asserted that even good writers differ so
much in their use of punctuation marks that it is impossible to
lay down any general rules, and that it is better for each one
to consult his own taste and judgment. With equal reason
it might be said that inasmuch as good speakers, and even
lexicographers, differ in the pronunciation of words, therefore
each speaker should make his own taste and judgment
the standard for correct pronunciation. A writer’s mode of
expressing his thoughts will determine the character and
number of the punctuation marks that he uses, and it is
chiefly owing to this that even good writers differ somewhat
in punctuating what they have written. There are some
rules that are invariable under all circumstances; the use of
others depends on the mental characteristics of the writer;
and there are still other rules, the application of which is
determined by the writer’s taste alone.</p>

<p>By gestures, tones of voice, oratorical pauses, emphasis,
and in various ways, a speaker can make his meaning clear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span>
to his listeners; and so a writer should certainly use all the
aids which punctuation, capitals, and italics afford, in presenting
clearly what he has written for the perusal of others.
Business men, however, seem to think that they are not
amenable to the rules that govern good writers. They
affirm that they have no time to punctuate their letters, and
yet they subject others to the necessity of expending time
and patience in trying to make out their meaning. Serious
misunderstandings have arisen between business men, in
consequence of the omission or incorrect use of punctuation
marks, and expensive lawsuits have originated in the careless
punctuation of legal instruments.</p>

<p>Very little attention is paid in our public schools to punctuation,
and the rules usually given in English Composition
are either disregarded or not properly understood. This
may, perhaps, be accounted for by the fact that the rules are
wanting in clearness, and are not sufficiently illustrated by
examples. The aim of this volume is to remedy, in some
measure, these evils, and to secure more attention to what
ought to be a prominent part of school instruction. The
evils of bad punctuation are really more serious than the
evils of bad spelling, and no student can be said to have
learned to read well, much less to write well, who has not
studied punctuation intelligently.</p>

<p>We would suggest that this hand-book be used at Rhetorical
Exercises, and that when essays, orations, criticisms, &amp;c.,
are handed to the teacher for correction, he should use a red
or a blue pencil, so that corrections may be the more readily
recognized. Besides the corrections in grammar, spelling,
&amp;c., he should be careful to supply punctuation marks when
needed, cross out needless ones, and, of course, make such
other corrections as may be necessary. When the productions
are returned to the pupils, the teacher should first point
out the necessity of using certain marks, in order to define<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_v"></a>[v]</span>
and bring out the meaning, and to show the relation between
the different members of a sentence. Having thus shown
the need of punctuation marks, then reference should be
made to some of the simpler rules, to impress this need on
the mind. Great care should be taken not to perplex the
mind with too many rules before the necessity is created for
their use. The great difficulty in the study of punctuation
has been that many rules are committed to memory before
the need of their use has arisen, so that the mind is perplexed
and bewildered instead of enlightened. The rule, it
must be remembered, does not create the necessity; the
necessity creates the rule. Then, again, we think a great
mistake is made by having the beginner punctuate what
some one else has written. The better plan is for the pupil,
at the very outset, to punctuate what he himself has composed,
and in his effort to bring out his own meaning clearly,
he will, with the aid of a few rules, almost intuitively fall
into the habit of punctuating correctly.</p>

<p>The following suggestions may be of service:—</p>

<p>1. Do not give a pupil a rule to learn, unless it is clearly
founded upon examples taken from what he himself has
written.</p>

<p>2. Take, at first, the simplest, most frequently used, and
most readily understood rules.</p>

<p>3. Advance slowly, remembering that a few simple principles
clearly understood, are of much more practical benefit
than a number of misty rules hastily committed to memory.</p>

<p>In the preparation of this hand-book, the author is under
obligations to various authorities, but he is more especially
indebted to Wilson’s “Treatise on Punctuation.”</p>

<h3>Introduction.</h3>

<p>The principal punctuation marks are,—</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>1.</td>
    <td>The Comma</td>
    <td class="tdc">,</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2.</td>
    <td>The Semicolon</td>
    <td class="tdc">;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3.</td>
    <td>The Colon</td>
    <td class="tdc">:</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4.</td>
    <td>The Period</td>
    <td class="tdc">.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The comma indicates a somewhat close relationship
between the parts of a sentence; the semicolon,
a more distant relationship; the colon indicates
that the parts are almost independent of each other;
the period marks the close of a sentence, and indicates
that a thought is complete.</p>

<p>In simple sentences, when the words are closely
united together, and the relationship of the words
to each other is readily perceived, there is usually
no need of any punctuation marks, except a period
at the close. It should always be borne in mind
that punctuation marks are used primarily to assist
in bringing out the meaning of the writer, and not
to embellish a written or a printed page. In sentences
made up of parts that are closely related to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
each other, but, at the same time, distinct in character,
commas should be used. They are way-marks
for the accommodation of the reader. A production
unpunctuated presents as dreary a prospect to
the reader, as the level plain of Chaldæa presents
to the perplexed traveler who has lost himself
among the sandy mounds on the banks of the Euphrates,
and has nothing by which to direct his
course.</p>

<p>When the different parts of a sentence are somewhat
disconnected, and not closely related to each
other, a semicolon or colon should be used. Sentences
are sometimes very long and complicated.
It is then necessary to separate the main divisions
by semicolons, and the smaller by commas. Sometimes
the smaller parts of a sentence are separated
by commas and semicolons, and the main divisions
by colons.</p>

<p>The other marks in use are,—</p>

<h3>THE COMMA.</h3>

<h4>INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.</h4>

<p>In order to properly understand some of the
rules that are given in the following pages, it is absolutely
necessary to have a clear understanding of
the difference between a sentence and a clause. A
sentence is a combination of words expressing a
complete thought, and usually followed by a period;
a clause is a distinct part of a sentence. Some sentences
are simple in form, and have but one subject
and one finite verb; as, “Language is part of a
man’s character.”—<i>Coleridge.</i> Other sentences
are made up of clauses, each clause having a subject
and a verb; in other words, several clauses are
sometimes joined together to form one sentence; as,
“New forms of beauty start at once into existence,
and all the burial places of the memory give up
their dead.”—<i>Macaulay.</i> It will be easily seen
that clauses will be more readily recognized with
the eye, and more easily comprehended, if they are
separated from each other by punctuation marks.
This will be especially so, if the clauses are long.</p>

<p>In preparing this hand-book, the aim has been to
avoid, as much as possible, the use of technical
terms. Whenever such terms are used, explanations
will usually be found under the head of <i>Remarks</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule I.</span> <i>Independent Clauses.</i>—Independent
clauses should be separated from each other by
commas.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>“Savage was discomposed by the intrusion or
omission of a comma, and he would lament an error
of a single letter as a great calamity.”—<i>Dr. Johnson.</i></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Man wants but little here below,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Nor wants that little long.”—<i>Goldsmith.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Take short views, hope for the best, and trust
in God.”—<i>Sydney Smith.</i></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. An independent clause is one that is not dependent on
any other clause for the completion of its meaning; as, Take
short views | hope for the best | and trust in God. Independent
clauses are frequently connected by <i>and</i>, <i>or</i>, <i>nor</i>,
<i>but</i>.</p>

<p>2. When the clauses are short and closely united, the
comma may be omitted; as, “Death had lost its terrors and
pleasure its charms.”</p>

<p>3. When the clauses are long and divided into smaller
portions by commas, they should be separated from each
other by semicolons. See Rule I. p. <a href="#Page_23">23</a>.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule II.</span> <i>Dependent Clauses.</i>—Dependent
clauses should be separated from each other by
commas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>“If a man does not make new acquaintances as
he advances through life, he will soon find himself
left alone. A man, Sir, should keep his friendship
in constant repair.”—<i>Dr. Johnson.</i></p>

<p>“When Dr. Franklin wished to gain his enemy,
he asked him to do him a favor.”</p>

<p>“Clap an extinguisher upon your irony, if you
are unhappily blest with a vein of it.”—<i>Lamb.</i></p>

<p>“Although we seldom followed advice, we were
all ready enough to ask it.”—<i>Goldsmith.</i></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. A clause is said to be dependent, when it depends on
some other clause to complete its meaning; as, When Dr.
Johnson wished to gain his enemy | he asked him to do him
a favor. The first clause of this sentence would not be
complete in meaning without the second. Dependent
clauses usually commence with <i>if</i>, <i>when</i>, <i>since</i>, <i>because</i>, <i>until</i>,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>2. When clauses are closely connected, the comma may
be omitted; as, Mozart published some music when seven
years of age.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule III.</span> <i>Relative Clauses.</i>—1. A relative
clause should be separated from the rest of the
sentence by a comma.</p>

<p>2. But the comma should be omitted, when the
relative clause is so closely connected with what
precedes that it cannot be dropped without destroying
the sense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>1. “Men in a corner, who have the unhappiness
of conversing too little with present things.”—<i>Swift.</i></p>

<p>“The waters are nature’s storehouse, in which
she locks up her wonders.”—<i>Izaak Walton.</i></p>

<p>“He had on a coat made of that cloth called
thunder-and-lightning, which, though grown too
short, was much too good to be thrown away.”—<i>Goldsmith.</i></p>

<p>2. “Althworthy here betook himself to those
pleasing slumbers which a heart that hungers after
goodness is apt to enjoy when thoroughly satisfied.”—<i>Fielding.</i></p>

<p>“A man who is good for making excuses is good
for nothing else.”—<i>Dr. Franklin.</i></p>

<p>“Like Cæsar, Cortes wrote his own commentaries
in the heart of the stirring scenes which form
the subject of them.”—<i>Prescott.</i></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. Relative clauses are generally introduced by the relative
pronouns <i>who</i>, <i>which</i>, <i>that</i>, or <i>what</i>.</p>

<p>2. A comma should be placed before the relative clause,
even when it is necessary to complete the meaning of the
antecedent,—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging"><i>a.</i> When the relative is immediately followed by a word
or an expression inclosed in commas; as, “As a man,
he may not have deserved the admiration which he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
received from those, who, bewitched by his fascinating
society, worshiped him nightly in his favorite temple
at Button’s.”—<i>Macaulay.</i></p>

<p class="hanging"><i>b.</i> When the relative has several antecedents that are
separated from each other by commas; as, “All those
arts, rarities, and inventions, which vulgar minds gaze
at, the ingenious pursue, and all admire, are but the
relics of an intellect defaced with sin and time.”—<i>South.</i></p>

</div>

<p>3. The words <i>of which</i> are sometimes preceded by a
comma, even when they are necessary to complete the
meaning of the antecedent: as, “His mind was formed of
those firm materials, of which nature formerly hammered
out the Stoic, and upon which the sorrows of no man living
could make an impression.”—<i>Fielding.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule IV.</span> <i>Parenthetical Words and Phrases.</i>
When single words and phrases break the connection
between closely related parts of a sentence,
they should usually be separated by commas from
the rest of the sentence.</p>

<p>1. Words used parenthetically,—</p>

<ul>
<li>therefore,</li>
<li>indeed,</li>
<li>perhaps,</li>
<li>namely,</li>
<li>finally,</li>
<li>consequently,</li>
<li>however,</li>
<li>moreover,</li>
<li>nevertheless, &amp;c.</li>
</ul>

<p>2. Phrases used parenthetically,—</p>

<ul>

<p>1. “As an orator, indeed, he was not magnetic
or inspiring.”—<i>G. W. Curtis.</i></p>

<p>“There is, perhaps, no surer mark of folly, than
to attempt to correct the natural infirmities of those
we love.”—<i>Fielding.</i></p>

<p>“There is, however, a limit at which forbearance
ceases to be a virtue.”—<i>Burke.</i></p>

<p>“In short, he is a memorable instance of what
has been often observed, that the boy is the man in
miniature.”—<i>Boswell.</i></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. Words and phrases are said to be used parenthetically,
when they obstruct, as it were, the flow of the sentence, and
might be dropped without destroying the sense.</p>

<p>2. Whenever parenthetical words and phrases readily
coalesce with the rest of the sentence, it is better to omit
punctuation marks; as, “I am therefore exceedingly unwilling
that anything, however slight, which my illustrious
friend thought it worth while to express, with any degree of
point, should perish.”—<i>Boswell.</i></p>

<p>3. A distinction should be made between words used parenthetically,
and adverbs qualifying particular words; as,
“And with learning was united a mild and liberal spirit, too
often wanting in the princely colleges of Oxford.”—<i>Macaulay.</i></p>

<p>“That, too, has its eminent service.”—<i>Burke.</i></p>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule V.</span> <i>Parenthetical Expressions.</i>—Expressions
of a parenthetical character should be separated
from the rest of the sentence by commas.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>“She was tumbled early, by accident or design,
into a spacious closet of good old English reading,
without much selection or prohibition, and browsed
at will upon that fair and wholesome pasturage.”—<i>Lamb.</i></p>

<p>“He [Sheridan] who, in less than thirty years
afterward, held senates enchained by his eloquence
and audiences fascinated by his wit, was, by common
consent both of parent and preceptor, pronounced
a most impenetrable dunce.”—<i>Moore.</i></p>

<p>“It is clear that Addison’s serious attention, during
his residence at the university, was almost entirely
concentrated on Latin poetry.”—<i>Macaulay.</i></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. A distinction should be made between parenthetical
words and parenthetical expressions.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging"><i>a.</i> Parenthetical words can be omitted without destroying
the sense. See examples under Rule IV.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>b.</i> Parenthetical expressions obstruct the flow of the
sentence, but can not be omitted without either destroying
the sense, or changing the meaning intended
to be conveyed. See examples given above.</p>

</div>

<p>2. When parenthetical expressions are short, or closely
connected with the rest of the sentence, it is better to omit
punctuation marks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>3. Writers differ very much in omitting or using commas
in parenthetical expressions. It is sometimes immaterial
whether punctuation marks are used or not, but, in many
cases, there are few rules so well adapted to bring out the
meaning of the writer.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule VI.</span> <i>Inverted Expressions.</i>—Expressions
which are not in their natural order, are frequently
separated from the rest of the sentence by a comma.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>“In everything that relates to science, I am a
whole Encyclopædia behind the rest of the world.”—<i>Lamb.</i></p>

great cause of evil has proceeded from slight occasions.”—<i>Steele.</i></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. The natural order of the first sentence is, I am a whole
Encyclopædia behind the rest of the world in everything
that relates to science.</p>

<p>2. When the inverted expression is closely connected with
what follows, the commas should be omitted; as,—</p>

<p>“Of Addison’s childhood we know little.”—<i>Macaulay.</i></p>

<p>“That inward man I love that’s lined with virtue.”—<i>Beaumont

<p>Schiller has said, “Men’s words are ever bolder
than their deeds.”</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. An expression resembling a quotation should be preceded
by a comma; as, “Therefore the question still returns,
What is the First Principle of all things?”</p>

<p>2. Quotations and general statements introduced by <i>that</i>
are frequently preceded by a comma; as, “Tacitus says of
Agricola, that he governed his family, which many find to
be a harder task than to govern a province.”—<i>Arthur Helps.</i></p>

<p>3. When single words or a part of a sentence are quoted,
a comma should not be used; as, “His wife was a domesticated,
kind-hearted old soul, who had come with him ‘from
the queen city of the world,’ which, it seemed, was Philadelphia.”—<i>Dickens.</i></p>

<p>4. Quotation divided. “A man could not set his foot
down,” says Cortes, “unless on the corpse of an Indian.”—<i>Prescott.</i></p>

<p>5. When the quotation is a long one, it should be preceded
by a colon.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule VIII.</span> <i>Person or Thing Addressed.</i>—The
name of the person or thing addressed, together

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARK.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>When strong emotion is expressed, an exclamation point
should be used; as, “O Hamlet! thou hast cleft my heart
in twain.”—<i>Shakespeare.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule IX.</span> <i>Participial Clauses.</i>—Participial
clauses, having no grammatical connection with
the rest of the sentence, should be separated from
what follows, and, if they do not commence a sentence,
from what precedes, by commas.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>“Success being now hopeless, preparations were
made for a retreat.”—<i>Alison.</i></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>“Histories make men wise; poets, witty; the
mathematics, subtle; natural philosophy, deep;
moral, grave; logic and rhetoric, able to contend.”—<i>Bacon.</i></p>

<p>“Chaucer painted persons; Spenser, qualities.”</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. When the comma takes the place of an omitted verb,
the main clauses or numbers should be separated by semicolons.</p>

<p>2. Sometimes a comma does not take the place of an
omitted verb; as, “Some books are to be tasted, others to be
swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested.”—<i>Bacon.</i></p>

<p>“Reading maketh a full man, conference a ready man,
and writing an exact man.”—<i>Bacon.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule XI.</span> <i>Appositives.</i>—A noun in apposition
and its modifiers should be separated by commas
from the rest of the sentence.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>“When death, the great Reconciler, has come,
it is never our tenderness we repent of but our
severity.”—<i>George Eliot.</i></p>

<p>“The exploits of Mercury himself, the god of
cunning, may be easily imagined to surpass everything
achieved by profaner hands.”—<i>Leigh Hunt.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. An appositive is a word, placed by the side of some
other word to explain or characterize it.</p>

<p>2. The comma should be omitted,—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging"><i>a.</i> When two nouns without modifiers are in apposition;
as, Cicero the orator was born near Arpinum. If the
sentence was, Cicero, the greatest of Roman orators,
was born near Arpinum, commas would be necessary.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>b.</i> When a noun and a pronoun are in apposition; as,
Mercury himself surpassed everything achieved by
profaner hands.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>c.</i> When two pronouns are in apposition; as, He himself
did this.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>d.</i> Between the parts of a person’s name; as, George
William Curtis.</p>

</div>

<p>3. In annexing titles to a person’s name, whether the titles
are abbreviated or written in full, commas must be used; as,
Richard Whately, D. D., Archbishop of Dublin.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule XII.</span> <i>Words in Pairs.</i>—Words in pairs
should have a comma between each pair.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. When two nouns, the subjects of a verb, are not connected
by a conjunction, a comma should be placed between
the two words and also after the second; as, “Indignation,
expostulation, were powerless upon him as a mist upon a
rock.”—<i>Macdonald.</i></p>

<p>2. When two adjectives come together, the first qualifying
the second adjective and also the noun, a comma should
not be used; as, A beautiful white horse.</p>

<p>3. A word repeated for emphasis usually has a punctuation
mark before and after it; as,—</p>

series of words, of the same part of speech, are
connected by <i>and</i>, <i>or</i>, <i>nor</i>, they should not be separated

<p>“The fruits and flowers and shrubs sent forth
grateful perfumes.”—<i>Irving.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>Some writers place a comma before each <i>and</i>. This, however,
is not necessary.</p>

<p>2. When a conjunction is used only with the last
word in the series, a comma should be placed before
the conjunction and between the other words.</p>

<p>The fruits, flowers, and shrubs sent forth grateful
perfumes.</p>

<p>3. When the conjunctions are omitted, a comma
should be placed between each word and also at
the end of the series.</p>

<p>The fruits, flowers, shrubs, sent forth grateful
perfumes.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. When the last word in the series precedes only a single
word, the comma should be omitted; as, “A refined, thoughtful,
warm-hearted, pure-souled Englishman.”</p>

<p>2. When two words or expressions are connected by <i>or</i>,
the latter explaining the former, the explanatory word or
expression should be separated from the rest of the sentence
by a comma or commas; as, “The love of variety, or curiosity
of seeing new things, which is the same, or at least a
sister passion to it, seems woven into the frame of every
son and daughter of Adam.”—<i>Sterne.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule XV.</span> <i>Phrases and Clauses.</i>—Phrases and

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>“Purity of style, and an easy flow of numbers,

<p>“The little that is known, and the circumstance
that little is known, must be considered as honorable

<p>“Books that you can carry to the fire, and hold
readily in your hand, are the most useful after all.”—<i>Dr.
Johnson.</i></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. A phrase is one of the smaller divisions of a sentence,
and consists of two or more words. Apart from the rest of
the sentence, it is incomplete in meaning. It does not, like
a clause, include a subject and a verb.</p>

<p>2. When two brief expressions are connected by a conjunction,
it is better to omit punctuation marks; as, “Good
company and good discourse are the very sinews of virtue.”—<i>Izaak
Walton.</i></p>

<p>3. When words and phrases form a series, a conjunction
being used only with the last phrase, they should be separated
from each other and from what follows by commas;
as, “Virtue, merit, and everything that is praiseworthy, will
be made the subject of ridicule and buffoonery.”—<i>Addison.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule XVI.</span> <i>Logical Subject.</i>—When the logical
subject ends with a verb, or is separated into

should be placed between the logical subject and
the main verb.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>“This imaginary promise of divine aid thus
mysteriously given, appeared to him at present in
still greater progress of fulfillment.”—<i>Irving.</i></p>

<p>“The voice of praise, too, coming from those to
whom we had thought ourselves unknown, has a
magic about it that must be felt to be understood.”—<i>Charles
Lever.</i></p>

<p>“Those who can put the best countenance upon
the outrages of this nature which are offered them,
are not without their secret anguish.”—<i>Addison.</i></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. The logical subject consists of the name of the person
or thing, of which something is affirmed, together with its
modifying words. It is “the subject according to the real
meaning or logic of the sentence.”</p>

<p>2. Some writers always place a comma before the verb,
when its subject consists of many words.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule XVII.</span> <i>Contrasted Expressions.</i>—Contrasted
expressions or comparisons should be separated
by a comma.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>“Of the other two men, one was a species of
giant, the other a sort of dwarf.”—<i>Hugo.</i></p>

<p>“As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so
panteth my soul after thee, O God.”—<i>Psalms.</i></p>

<p>“Master books, but do not let them master you.
Read to live, not live to read.”—<i>Bulwer.</i></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. When the comparison is short and the words closely
connected, the comma may be omitted.</p>

<p>2. When <i>so—that</i>, <i>so—as</i>, <i>rather—than</i>, <i>more—than</i>, connect
expressions, the comma is usually omitted; as, “Ingratitude
never so thoroughly pierces the human heart as when it
proceeds from those in whose behalf we have been guilty of
transgression.”—<i>Fielding.</i></p>

<p>When, however, the expressions themselves are divided
into smaller parts by commas, or are unusually long, they
should be separated by a comma; as,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent12">“So over-violent, or over-civil,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That every man with him was God or Devil.”—<i>Dryden.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>3. When two short expressions are united by <i>as</i> or <i>than</i>, a
comma should not be used; as,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“He knew what’s what, and that’s as high</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As metaphysic wit can fly.”—<i>Butler.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When, however, the expressions are long, it is better to
use a comma; as, “I have no more pleasure in hearing a
man attempting wit and failing, than in seeing a man trying
to leap over a ditch and tumbling into it.”—<i>Dr. Johnson.</i></p>

<p>4. When the first expression is negative and the other
affirmative, a comma should be placed between the expressions
and before the negative word, if it does not commence
a sentence; as, “The world generally gives its admiration,
not to the man who does what nobody else even attempts to
do, but to the man who does best what multitudes do well.”—<i>Macaulay.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>If, however, a finite verb immediately precedes the negative
word, the comma should be omitted; as, “Our greatest
glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we
fall.”—<i>Confucius.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule XVIII.</span> <i>Numeral Figures.</i>—Arabic

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule XIX.</span> <i>Expressions at the End of Sentences.</i>—It
is frequently necessary, at the end of a
sentence, to separate an expression beginning with
a preposition from the rest of the sentence, in order
to avoid ambiguity.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“He trudged along, unknowing what he sought,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And whistled as he went, for want of thought.”—<i>Dryden.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Angling is always to be considered as a stick
and a string, with a fly at one end and a fool at the
other.”—<i>Swift.</i></p>

<h4>GENERAL REMARK.</h4>

<p>A comma should always be used, when it aids
in bringing out the meaning of the writer, or in
avoiding ambiguity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<h3>THE SEMICOLON.</h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule I.</span> <i>Long Sentences.</i>—When the smaller
divisions of sentences are separated by commas, the
main divisions should be separated by semicolons.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>“Sheridan, Pitt, and Fox all drank hard and
worked hard; they were all great in the councils of

<p>“Nor is it always in the most distinguished
achievements that men’s virtues or vices may be
best discerned; but very often an action of small
note, a short saying, or a jest, shall distinguish a
person’s real character more than the greatest
sieges, or the most important battles.”—<i>Plutarch.</i></p>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule II.</span> <i>Expressions Complete in Themselves.</i>—Short
expressions, complete in themselves but
slightly connected in meaning, may be separated
by semicolons.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>“We do not want precepts so much as patterns;
an example is the softest and least invidious way of

genius as well as by reading.”—<i>Sheridan.</i></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARK.</p>

<div class="remarks">

placed before and a comma after it.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule III.</span> <i>Series of Expressions.</i>—When
several clauses follow each other in succession,
having a common dependence on some part of the
sentence, they should be separated from each other
by semicolons, and from the clause on which they
depend, by a comma.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLE.</p>

<p>“If such men will make a firm and solemn pause,
and meditate dispassionately on its importance; if
they will contemplate it in all its attributes, and
trace it to all its consequences, they will not hesitate
to part with trivial objections to a constitution,
the rejection of which would, in all probability, put
a final period to the Union.”—<i>Hamilton.</i></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARK.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>Commas may be used instead of semicolons, when the
clauses are short; as, “When public bodies are to be addressed
on momentous occasions, when great interests are at stake,
and strong passions excited, nothing is valuable in speech
farther than it is connected with high intellectual and moral

<h4>GENERAL REMARK.</h4>

<p>When the members of a sentence seem to be
loosely connected, they are frequently separated by
semicolons.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>“Honest name is goodly; but he that hunteth
only for that, is like him that hath rather seem
warm than be warm.”—<i>Sir Thomas Wyatt.</i></p>

<p>“Some blemishes may undoubtedly be detected
in his character; but the more carefully it is examined,
the more will it appear sound in the noble
parts.”—<i>Macaulay.</i></p>

<p>Some writers use commas in the examples given
above in preference to semicolons, and usage varies
so much among our best writers that it is impossible
to lay down a general rule that will be applicable
in all cases. If it is desirable to indicate a somewhat
close connection between the members of a
sentence, a comma should be used; if the connection
is slight, it is better to use a semicolon.</p>

<h3>THE COLON.</h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule I.</span> <i>Long Sentences.</i>—When the smaller
divisions of sentences are separated by semicolons,
the main divisions should be separated by a colon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>“Emulation is a dangerous passion to encourage,
in some points, in young men; it is so linked with
envy: if you reproach your son for not surpassing
his school-fellows, he will hate those who are
before him.”—<i>Sheridan.</i></p>

<p>“A man over ninety is a great comfort to all his
elderly neighbors: he is a picket-guard at the
extreme outpost; and the young folks of sixty and
seventy feel that the enemy must get by him before
he can come near the camp.”—<i>O. W. Holmes.</i></p>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule II.</span> <i>A Quotation.</i>—A colon should precede
a long quotation. If, however, the quotation
is short, it is better to use a comma.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>Socrates recommended to one of his disciples the
following prayer: “O Jupiter, give us those things
which are good for us, whether they are such
things as we pray for, or such things as we do not
pray for; and remove from us those things which
are hurtful, though they are such things as we pray
for.”</p>

<p>When the Earl of Dudley took leave of Sydney
Smith, on going from London to Yorkshire, he
said: “You have been laughing at me constantly,
Sydney, for the last seven years, and yet, in all that
time, you never said a single thing to me that I
wished unsaid.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARK.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. When the quotation is long, or it begins a new paragraph,
a dash is frequently placed after the colon.</p>

<p>2. When a direct quotation is introduced into the middle
of a sentence, a comma should be used; as, “He was surprised,
but replied, ‘I am not the king, he is there,’ pointing
at the same time to a different part of the hall.”—<i>Lingard.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule III.</span> <i>Enumeration of Particulars.</i>—A
colon should precede an enumeration of particulars,
when they are formally introduced by <i>thus</i>, <i>following</i>,
<i>as follows</i>, <i>this</i>, <i>these</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>“We hold these truths to be self-evident: that
all men are created equal; that they are endowed
by their Creator with inalienable rights: that
among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness.”—<i>Jefferson.</i></p>

<p>“The penalty is graduated thus: the mildest,
confiscation; the moderate, closing the shop; the
severest, exposure.”—<i>Lippincott’s Magazine.</i></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. When the particulars are preceded by a colon, they are
usually separated from each other by semicolons, as in the
examples given above.</p>

<p>2. If the particulars are not introduced by <i>thus</i>, <i>following</i>,
&amp;c., they should be preceded by a semicolon; as, “Grammar
is divided into four parts; Orthography, Etymology, Syntax,
and Prosody.”</p>

<p>3. When the particulars are preceded by a semicolon, they
are usually separated from each other by commas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>4. Sometimes a comma and dash are used instead of a
semicolon; as, “Grammar is divided into four parts,—Orthography,
Etymology, Syntax, and Prosody.”</p>

</div>

<h4>GENERAL REMARK.</h4>

<p>The colon is used by some writers to separate
short expressions that are complete in themselves,
but slightly connected in meaning.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“But men are men: the best sometimes forget.”—<i>Shakespeare.</i></div>

<p>“It [the Seine] is the wash-tub and summer
bath-tub of its citizens; it was the birthplace of
Paris, and it is too often the grave of her children.”—<i>Lippincott’s
Magazine.</i></p>

<p>If a conjunction is used, it is better to use a semicolon;
as,—</p>

<p>“She cannot separate her name from his without
lessening it; for it is equally incrusted with his
greatness as with his faults.”—<i>Lamartine.</i></p>

<p>She cannot separate her name from his without
lessening it: it is equally incrusted with his greatness
as with his faults.</p>

<p>The colon is not as commonly used as formerly.
A semicolon would be preferred by very many
writers in all sentences similar to the examples
given above. See Rule II. p. <a href="#Page_23">23</a>.</p>

<h3>THE PERIOD.</h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule I.</span> <i>Complete Sentences.</i>—A period should
be placed at the end of a sentence, when it is complete
in meaning and construction, and is declarative
or imperative in its nature.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>“Swift boasted that he was never known to steal
a hint.”—<i>Macaulay.</i></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>“It is a great evil not to be able to bear an evil.”—<i>Bion.</i></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARK.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>A period should always be placed after the title of an

</ul>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. It should be remembered that the period thus used, simply
indicates an abbreviation, and that punctuation marks
are to be used, in addition to the period, when required.
When a word, written in full, requires a punctuation mark
after it, the same punctuation mark should be used after the
word, when it is abbreviated; as, Adrian, Michigan, January
5, 1877; Adrian, Mich., Jan. 5, 1877.</p>

<p>2. Some proper names are not abbreviations, and consequently
a period should not be used; as, Ben Jonson, Fred
Knapp. When Ben. stands for Benjamin, and Fred. for
Frederick, a period should be used.</p>

<p>3. When numerals are represented by the letters of the
alphabet, periods are placed after them; as, Gen. vii. 1, 7, 8.</p>

<p>4. In numbering pages, no mark should be placed after 1,
2, 3, 4, &amp;c.</p>

<p>5. When a letter, used as an abbreviation, is doubled to
indicate the plural, the period should be placed after the last
letter; as, pp. for pages, LL. D. for Doctor of Laws.</p>

<p>6. In abbreviating words, sometimes the first letters are
used, sometimes the first and last, and sometimes the first
and some letter near the middle of the word; as, Ala. for
Alabama, Chas. for Charles, Wm. for William, MS. for
manuscript.</p>

<p>7. A list of abbreviations will be found at the close of any
good dictionary.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. When the connection between the interjection and what

<p>2. When it is desirable to express strong feeling through-out
an entire sentence, the exclamation point should be
placed at the end; as,—</p>

<h3>THE DASH.</h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule I.</span> <i>Broken Sentences.</i>—When a sentence
is broken off abruptly, or there is an unexpected
change in the sentiment, or hesitation is to be indicated,
a dash should be used.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Prince.</i>—“I tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,—”</div>

<p>“You will think me foolish;—but—but—may it
not be that some invisible angel has been attracted
by the simplicity and good faith with which our
children set about their undertaking? May he not
have spent an hour of his immortality in playing
with those dear little souls?”—<i>Hawthorne.</i></p>

<p>“Men will wrangle for religion; write for it;
fight for it; die for it; anything but—<i>live for it</i>.”—<i>Colton.</i></p>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule II.</span> <i>Concluding Clause.</i>—When several
expressions follow each other in succession, having
a common dependence on the concluding part of
the sentence, a dash is frequently placed before the
clause on which they depend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>“If you think it a crime in this writer that his
language has not been braided and festooned as
elegantly as it might be; that he has not pinched
the miserable plaits of his phraseology, nor placed
his patches and feathers with that correctness of
millinery which became him,—then find a civil
and obliging verdict against the printer!”—<i>Curran.</i></p>

<p>“To foster industry, to promote union, to cherish
religious peace,—these were the honest purposes
of Lord Baltimore during his long supremacy.”—<i>Bancroft.</i></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. A dash is sometimes used to give prominence or emphasis
to an emphatic conclusion; as, “Fortune, friends, kindred,
home,—all were gone.”—<i>Prescott.</i></p>

<p>2. When such words as <i>namely</i>, <i>that is</i>, &amp;c., are omitted, a
dash is sometimes used; as, “Many actions, like the Rhone,
have two sources,—one pure, and the other impure.”—<i>Hare.</i></p>

<p>3. When a word or an expression is repeated for emphasis, a
dash should be placed before it; as, “It is this, I conjure
Your Lordships, for your honor, for the honor of the nation,
for the honor of human nature, now intrusted to your care,—it
is this duty that the Commons of England, speaking
through us, claims at your hands.”—<i>Sheridan.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule III.</span> <i>Subjects.</i>—When the subject of a
general statement, or the subject of a quotation, is
in the same paragraph with the subject-matter, a
dash should separate the subject from what follows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>The Bible.—“A person who professes to be a
critic in the niceties of the English language ought
to have the Bible at his fingers’ ends.”—<i>Macaulay.</i></p>

<p>Letter-Writing.—“Common interests are necessary
to give permanent stability to epistolary connections.
We may love a man dearly, and yet find
no time to write ten lines to him.”—<i>From the German
of Rudolph Lindau.</i></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. A subject is a word or expression about which some
statement is made.</p>

<p>2. A dash should be placed between a quotation and the
author from whom the quotation is taken.</p>

<p>3. When a question and an answer are in the same paragraph,
a dash is frequently inserted between the two; as, “Saw
you my lord?”—“No, lady.”</p>

<p>4. When <i>as</i>, <i>thus</i>, <i>as follows</i>, &amp;c., introduce an example or
a quotation, a dash should be placed after the comma or
colon, if what follows commences a new paragraph; as,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule IV.</span> <i>Letters or Figures Omitted.</i>—When
letters or figures are omitted, a dash should be
used to indicate the omission.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>“Why, to comfort me, must Alice W⸺n be a
goblin?”—<i>Lamb.</i></p>

<p>3-9 is equivalent to 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>

</div>

<h4>GENERAL REMARK.</h4>

<p>The dash is frequently used to give prominence
or emphasis to an expression.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>“In the quiet air, there was a sound of distant
singing,—shepherd voices.”—<i>Dickens.</i></p>

<p>“Wealth has its temptations,—so has power.”—<i>Robertson.</i></p>

<p>“The poorest man may in his cottage bid defiance
to all the force of the crown. It may be
frail; its roof may shake; the wind may blow
through it; the storms may enter, the rains may
enter,—but the king of England cannot enter! all
his forces dare not cross the threshold of the ruined
tenement.”—<i>Pitt.</i></p>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule V.</span> <i>Parenthesis.</i>—Two dashes are sometimes
used instead of the usual marks of parenthesis.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>“A yellow claw—the very same that had clawed
together so much wealth—poked itself out of the
coach window, and dropt some copper coins upon
the ground.”—<i>Hawthorne.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>“Jackson—the omniscient Jackson he was called—was
of this period. He had the reputation of
possessing more multifarious knowledge than any
man of his time.”—<i>Lamb.</i></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. When the sentence, without the parenthesis, would
require a comma where the dashes are used, each dash
should be preceded by a comma; as, “See that aged couple,—a
sad sight, truly,—John Proctor, and his wife Elizabeth.”—<i>Hawthorne.</i></p>

<p>2. If the parenthetical expression is a question or expresses
emotion, an interrogation or an exclamation point should be
placed before the second dash; as, “The laurel of the hero—alas
for humanity that it should be so!—grows best on the
battle field.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<h3>MARKS OF PARENTHESIS.</h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule I.</span> <i>Parenthesis.</i>—When an expression
breaks the connection between the different parts
of a sentence, and might be omitted without affecting
the sense or the construction, it should be
inclosed in parenthetical marks.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>“Of all sound of all bells (bells, the music nighest
bordering heaven) most solemn and touching is
the peal which rings out the Old Year.”—<i>Lamb.</i></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The tuneful Nine (so sacred legends tell)</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">First waked their heavenly lyre these scenes to tell!”—<i>Campbell.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Their intellectual wardrobe (to confess fairly)
has few whole pieces in it.”—<i>Lamb.</i></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. When parenthetical marks are used, it is sometimes
necessary to use additional marks.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging"><i>a.</i> When the sentence, without the parenthesis, requires
a punctuation mark where the parenthetical marks
are used, the punctuation mark should be placed after
the last mark of the parenthesis; as,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Know then this truth (enough for man to know),</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Virtue alone is happiness below.’”—<i>Pope.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p class="hanging"><i>b.</i> Sometimes the parenthesis requires a punctuation
mark before the last mark of the parenthesis; as,
“Spill not the morning (the quintessence of the day!)
in recreations.”—<i>Thomas Fuller.</i></p>

<p class="hanging"><i>c.</i> When a punctuation mark immediately precedes the
last mark of the parenthesis, and a punctuation mark
is also needed where the parenthetical marks are used,
it should be placed before the first mark of the parenthesis;
as, “F. was the most gentlemanly of oilmen.
He had two Latin words almost constantly in his
mouth, (how odd sounds Latin from an oilman’s lips!)
which my better knowledge since has enabled me to
correct.”—<i>Lamb.</i></p>

</div>

<p>2. An interrogation point inclosed in parenthetical marks
(?) implies that an assertion is doubtful.</p>

<p>3. An exclamation point inclosed within parenthetical
marks (!) expresses irony or contempt.</p>

<p>4. Parenthetical marks are not as frequently used as formerly,
the comma and dash being often preferred.</p>

<h3>BRACKETS.</h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule I.</span> <i>Quoted Passage.</i>—When words are
inserted by another into a quoted passage, either to
correct a mistake or explain the meaning, they
should be inclosed in brackets.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>“A variety of pleasing objects meet [meets] the

<p>“‘My dear lady,’ returned the schoolmaster [Mr.

not to be unmade, except on equally good grounds
with those upon which it was made.’”—<i>George
Macdonald.</i></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. Punctuation marks are sometimes required, when the
brackets are used. The same remarks apply to the brackets
that apply to parenthetical marks.</p>

<p>2. In reporting speeches, brackets are used, when words
are introduced by the reporter which do not form a part of
the speech; as,—</p>

<p>“We would have our Union to be a union of hearts, and we
would have our Constitution obeyed, not merely because of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
force that compels obedience, but obeyed because the people
love the principles of the Constitution [long continued
applause], and to-day, if I am called to the work to which
Abraham Lincoln was called sixteen years ago, it is under
brighter skies and more favorable auspices. [Applause.] I
do hope, I do fervently believe, that, by the aid of divine
Providence, we may do something in this day of peace, by
works of peace, towards re-establishing, in the hearts of our
countrymen, a real, a hearty attachment to the Constitution
as it is, and to the Union as it is. [Long continued applause].”—<span class="smcap">President
Hayes.</span>—<i>Chicago Tribune.</i></p>

<p>3. Parenthetical marks are frequently used instead of
brackets.</p>

<h3>QUOTATION MARKS.</h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule I.</span> <i>Direct Quotation.</i>—When the exact
words of another are given, they should be inclosed
in quotation marks.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>“He had the longest tongue and the shortest
temper of any man, high or low, I ever met with.”—<i>Wilkie
Collins.</i></p>

<p>Prescott, in his “Conquest of Mexico,” tells us
that intemperance among the Aztecs “was punished
in the young with death, and in older persons
with loss of rank and confiscation of property.”</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. When the exact words of another are not given, quotation
marks should not be used; as,—</p>

<p>Longfellow says,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Deeds are better things than words are.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Longfellow somewhere says that deeds are better than
words.</p>

<p>2. When words are quoted from a foreign language, they
should be printed in italics, and the quotation marks omitted;
as, “They have their good glebe lands <i>in manu</i>, and care
not much to rake into title deeds.”—<i>Lamb.</i></p>

<p>3. When words are to be italicized, a straight mark should
be drawn underneath the words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>4. When a quotation is followed by a comma, semicolon,
colon, or period, the punctuation mark should be placed
within the quotation marks; as, “Mr. M’Adam writes sometimes
with genuine humor, and an occasional entirely original
simile shows evidence of the possession of what phrenologists
call the faculty of ‘comparison;’ but the charm of the
book is its rare perspicacity.”—<i>Harper’s Magazine.</i></p>

<p>5. When a quotation is followed by an exclamation or an
interrogation point, the punctuation mark should be placed
within the quotation marks, if it forms a part of the quotation;
as, “I feel almost like groaning, when a young mother
shows me some marvel of embroidery or machine-stitching,
saying triumphantly, ‘There, I did every stitch of that myself!’”—<i>Scribner’s
Monthly.</i></p>

<p>6. When a quotation is followed by an exclamation or an
interrogation point, the punctuation mark should be placed
outside of the quotation marks, if it belongs to the whole
sentence and not to the quotation; as, “We wonder what
Handel would have said to Mozart’s scoring of ‘I know that
my Redeemer liveth’!”—<i>Atlantic Monthly.</i> “Why cannot
we hear, for instance, the wonderful curioso, ‘He gave his
back to the smiters,’ that forms the second part of the air,
‘He was despised,’ and the duet for contralto and tenor, ‘O
death where is thy sting’?”—<i>Atlantic Monthly.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule II.</span> <i>Titles of Books.</i>—Titles of books are
generally inclosed in quotation marks.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>Morris’s “Story of Sigurd.”—<i>Scribner’s Monthly.</i></p>

<p>“The Mikado’s Empire.”—<i>N. A. Review.</i></p>

<p>“Daniel Deronda.”—<i>Contemporary Review.</i></p>

<p>The Rev. W. W. Capes’s history of “The Early
Roman Empire.”—<i>Appleton’s Journal.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. The names of magazines and papers are generally
printed in italics; as, <i>The Atlantic</i>, <i>N. Y. Nation</i>, <i>Fraser’s
Magazine</i>, <i>Appleton’s Journal</i>, <i>Nature</i>, <i>Popular Science
Monthly</i>.</p>

<p>2. In examining <i>The Atlantic</i>, <i>Nation</i>, <i>Scribner’s Monthly</i>,
<i>Harper’s</i>, <i>Appleton’s Magazine</i>, <i>Lippincott’s</i>, <i>Popular Science
Monthly</i>, <i>Galaxy</i>, <i>Eclectic</i>, <i>N. A. Review</i>, <i>New Englander</i>,
<i>London Quarterly</i>, <i>British Quarterly</i>, <i>Westminster Review</i>,
<i>Edinburgh Review</i>, <i>Contemporary Review</i>, <i>The Fortnightly
Review</i>, we find that thirteen of these use quotation marks,
and four use italics, in referring to the titles of books; eleven
use italics, and six use quotation marks, in referring to magazines
and papers.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule III.</span> <i>A Quotation within a Quotation.</i>—When
there is a quotation within a quotation, single
marks should be used in addition to double
marks.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>“Who was the blundering idiot who said that
‘fine words butter no parsnips.’ Half the parsnips
of society are served and rendered palatable with
no other sauce.”—<i>Thackeray.</i></p>

<p>“There is a small but ancient fraternity, known
as the Order of Gentlemen. It is a grand old order.
A poet has said that Christ founded it; that
he was ‘the first true gentleman that ever lived.’”—<i>Winthrop.</i></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. Sometimes the quotation within a quotation has a word
or phrase that is quoted. The word or phrase must be inclosed
in double marks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>2. In quoting Scripture, it is customary to place only
double marks at the beginning and end of the quotation; as,
“And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand,
and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.”—<i>Mark
i. 41.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule IV.</span> <i>Paragraphs.</i>—When several paragraphs
are quoted in succession, double marks
should be placed at the beginning of each paragraph,
and at the end of the entire quotation.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLE.</p>

<p>“The children woke. The little girl was the
first to open her eyes.</p>

<p>“The waking of children is like the unclosing of
flowers, a perfume seems to exhale from those fresh
young souls. Georgette, twenty months old, the
youngest of the three, who was still a nursing baby
in the month of May, raised her little head, sat up
in her cradle, looked at her feet, and began to chatter.</p>

<p>“A ray of morning fell across her crib; it would
have been difficult to decide which was the rosiest,
Georgette’s foot or Aurora.”—<i>Hugo.</i></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. A paragraph usually consists of several sentences. It
begins on a new line, and is distinguished by a blank space
on the left, at the commencement of the paragraph.</p>

<p>2. When parts of a quotation are omitted, use several
stars to indicate the omission (* * * *), or place double
marks at the beginning and end of each detached part of the
quotation.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<h3>THE APOSTROPHE.</h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule I.</span> <i>Letters Omitted.</i>—The apostrophe is
used to indicate the omission of a letter or letters.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>“O Marcia, O my sister, still there’s hope!”—<i>Addison.</i></p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARK.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>The apostrophe is made like a comma, but is placed above
the line.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule II.</span> <i>Possession.</i>—The apostrophe is used
to denote possession.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>Taine’s “English Literature.” Rawlinson’s “Ancient
Monarchies.”</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. The apostrophe and <i>s</i> should be used with nouns in the
singular, even when the word ends in <i>s</i> or <i>x</i>; as,—</p>

<ul>
<li>“Dickens’s Works.”—<i>Appleton’s Journal.</i></li>
<li>“Cox’s General History of Greece.”—<i>Harper’s Magazine.</i></li>
<li>“Evans’s observations.”—<i>Edinburgh Review.</i></li>

<p>In addition to the periodicals given above, <i>The Atlantic</i>,
<i>Scribner’s Monthly</i>, <i>Lippincott’s Magazine</i>, <i>Popular Science
Monthly</i>, <i>Galaxy</i>, <i>N. A. Review</i>, <i>London Quarterly</i>, <i>British
Quarterly</i>, <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, use the additional <i>s</i>. The
<i>Westminster</i> omits the additional <i>s</i>. In the <i>Contemporary</i>
and <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, the <i>s</i> is used by some writers and
omitted by others.</p>

<p>2. In the plural of nouns, the apostrophe and <i>s</i> are used
to denote possession, when the word does not end in <i>s</i>; as,
men’s deeds. If the word ends in <i>s</i>, the apostrophe only is
used; as, my neighbors’ house.</p>

<p>3. The apostrophe should not be used before <i>s</i> in ours,
yours, hers, theirs, its.</p>

<h3>THE HYPHEN.</h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule I.</span> <i>Compound Words.</i>—The hyphen is
used to connect the parts of a compound word.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>“My household-gods plant a terrible fixed foot,
and are not to be rooted up without blood.”—<i>Lamb.</i></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The breezy call of incense-breathing morn.”—<i>Gray.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. A compound word is formed by placing together two
simple words.</p>

<p>2. Sometimes several words are connected together by
hyphens; as, “He had a lively touch-and-go-away with him,
very pleasant and engaging I admit.”—<i>Wilkie Collins.</i></p>

<p>3. When a compound word comes into very general use,
the hyphen is sometimes omitted; as, railroad, steamboat,
bookstore.</p>

<p>4. To-day, to-night, to-morrow, should always be written
with a hyphen.</p>

<p>5. When there is any doubt whether two words should be
united by a hyphen or written as one word, some standard
dictionary should be consulted. It will, however, be found
that even dictionaries differ somewhat in the use and omission
of the hyphen in compound words. In order to preserve
some uniformity in spelling and in the formation of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
compound words, every writer should make either Webster
or Worcester the final authority.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule II.</span> <i>Prefixes.</i>—When a prefix ends in a
vowel, and the word to which it is joined commences
with a vowel, they should be separated by
a hyphen.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>Re-admit, co-ordinate, pre-existence, pre-eminent.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. A prefix is a letter, syllable, or word, placed before some
word, thus forming a new word.</p>

<p>2. If, instead of two vowels, a vowel and a consonant come
together, the prefix and the word to which it is joined should
usually be written as one word; as, rewrite, predetermine.</p>

<p>3. Vice-president, and most words with <i>vice</i> as a prefix,
should be written with a hyphen.</p>

<p>4. Some writers use the diæresis instead of the hyphen.
With prefixes it is better to use the hyphen, but in other
words containing two vowels that do not form a diphthong,
the diæresis should be used; as, Zoölogy.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule III.</span> <i>Division of Words.</i>—When it is
necessary to write part of a word at the end of a
line and part at the beginning of the next line, the
division should be made at the end of a syllable,
and the parts should be connected by a hyphen, at
the end of the line.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLE.</p>

<p>“Knowledge is of two kinds. We know a sub-<br>
ject ourselves, or we know where we can find in-<br>
formation upon it.”—<i>Dr. Johnson.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. It is better to divide a word as near the middle as possible.</p>

<p>2. When two words one at the end of a line and the other
at the commencement of the following line, are separated by
a punctuation mark, it should be placed at the end of the
line, and never at the beginning.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<h3>MISCELLANEOUS MARKS.</h3>

<p>I. <i>Two Commas</i> (”) indicate that the word under
which they are placed is to be repeated.</p>

<p>Charles Harrison, Adrian, Mich.</p>

<p>Clinton Hardy, <span class="ditto2">”</span> <span class="ditto2">”</span></p>

<p>II. <i>The Caret</i> (^) indicates that something is

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>It has been the custom among some writers to
commence every important word with a capital, so
that some printed productions have fairly bristled
with capitalized words; as,—</p>

<p>“Modern authors have with unwearied Pains
made many useful Searches into the weak Sides of
the Ancients, and given us a comprehensive Lift of
them.”—<i>Swift.</i></p>

<p>“There were a Race of Men who delighted to
nibble at the Superfluities and Excrescences of
Books.”—<i>Swift.</i></p>

<p>The custom of commencing all nouns with a
capital is still prevalent among the Germans of the
present day.</p>

<p>It is a somewhat interesting fact that the use and
value of capitals has been subject to a rise and fall
in the literary market, written productions during
some centuries abounding in them, while in other
centuries they have, in a great measure, been discarded,
and have become comparative strangers in
English composition.</p>

<p>In the early part of this century, there was a
tendency to use them to an inconsiderate extent,
owing principally to German imitators like Carlyle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
and others, who adopted, in a somewhat modified
form, the German method of capitalizing words.
Just at present there seems to be a reaction setting
in, and there is a tendency among some of our
leading publishing houses to dispense with their
use as much as possible. In democratic America,
there has always been a somewhat unreasonable
fear of official titles, and when they are used, they
are frequently belittled with small letters. This
has had a tendency to encourage the use of small
letters in many words that should properly commence
with capitals.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that a judicious use of capitals
assists the eye very much in reading what
another has written, and in understanding a writer’s
meaning. While, on the other hand, an injudicious
use lessens their value, and disfigures a printed
page.</p>

<p>Although the taste and judgment of each writer
may be consulted in the capitalization of some
words to which he may assign a special meaning,
there are a number of well established principles,
sanctioned by long usage, that should govern all
writers in the use of capital letters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<h3>CAPITALS.</h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule I.</span> <i>Sentences.</i>—The first word of every
sentence should commence with a capital.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The price we challenge for ourselves is given us.”—<i>Schiller.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“The elder brother of Franklin ventured to start
a newspaper, though warned that America could
never support two newspapers.”—<i>William Russel.</i></p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“Trust in yourself, and you have learnt to live.”—<i>Goethe.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. A sentence is an assemblage of words making complete
sense, and followed by a period. Sometimes a sentence has
an interrogation or an exclamation point at its close; as,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“For of the wholly common is man made,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And custom is his nurse!”—<i>Schiller.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>2. Any expression that is equivalent to a sentence should
commence with a capital; as, Very affectionately. Price
$5.00.</p>

<p>3. As a period indicates the close of a sentence, the word
following the period should commence with a capital; as,
“The little soul is like a vapor that hovers around a marshy
lake. It never rises on the green hill, lest the winds meet it
there.”—<i>Ossian.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>

<p>If, however, a period is used to indicate an abbreviation, it
should not be followed by a capital, unless it is at the close
of a sentence, or the word that follows it requires a capital;
as, In Germany, the degrees of M. D., LL. D., and Ph. D.
are only gained after passing a severe examination.</p>

<p>4. Although a capital is generally used after an interrogation
or an exclamation point, as they usually indicate the
close of a sentence, this is not always the case; as,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“How poor! how rich! how abject! how august!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How complicate! how wonderful is man!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How passing wonder He who made him such!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who centered in our make such strange extremes!”—<i>Young.</i></div>
  </div>

<p>1. When North, South, East, &amp;c., refer to political or geographical
divisions, they should commence with capitals;
as, “But sectional bitterness has in a great measure passed
away; the fatal cause of discord between North and South
has been removed.”</p>

<p>When these words refer merely to the points of the compass,
they should be written with small letters.</p>

<p>2. Words derived from the names of persons should commence
with capitals; as, Socratic, Platonic, Elizabethan.</p>

<p>When words derived from the names of persons or places
lose their individual character, and are used as common
words, they should commence with small letters; as, god-like,
hector, turkey, china-ware, laconic.</p>

<p>3. Heaven and hell are written with small letters in the
Bible. Satan is always printed with a capital, but devil commences
with a small letter, unless it stands for Satan; as,
“Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to
be tempted of the devil.”—Mat. iv. 1.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule IV.</span> <i>Nations.</i>—The names of nations, or
words derived from the names of nations, should
commence with capitals.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>“‘Simply to be poor,’ says my favorite Greek
historian, ‘was not held scandalous by the wise
Athenians; but highly so, to owe that poverty to
our own indiscretion.’”—<i>Fielding.</i></p>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule V.</span> <i>Sects and Parties.</i>—The names of
religious sects and political parties should commence
with capitals.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>Christian, Mohammedan, Lutheran, Catholic,
Protestant, Episcopal, Presbyterian, Baptist, Unitarian.</p>

<p>Republican, Federalist, Democrat, Whig, Tory,
Radical.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. When republican, radical, &amp;c., are used as common
words, and not as the names of political parties, they should
commence with small letters; as, republican institutions,
radical measures.</p>

<p>2. Some writers use small letters, when referring to political
parties. If, however, it is incorrect to write Congregational,
Methodist, with small letters, why is it not incorrect
to commence Republican, Whig, with small letters?</p>

<p>3. Church should be written with a capital, when it refers
to a religious sect; as, the Episcopal Church, meaning the
whole body of Christians belonging to that denomination.
When the word refers to a place of worship, it should commence
with a small letter.</p>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule VII.</span> <i>Titles of Books.</i>—All the words,

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>Forsyth’s “Life of Cicero.” “The Fall of the
Roman Republic,” Rev. C. Merivale.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. It is just as necessary to capitalize the title of a book,
as it is the name of a person.</p>

<p>2. The title of an oration, essay, article for a newspaper, or
of any written production, follows the same rule as the title
of a book.</p>

<p>3. Names of sacred writings should always be capitalized;
as, Bible, Old and New Testament, the Scriptures, Acts,
Revelation, Gospel of John, Koran, Vedas.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule VIII.</span> <i>Title-Pages.</i>—The title-pages of
books are generally printed entirely with capitals.
The title-page of any book will illustrate this rule.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. This rule concerns more especially the printer.</p>

<p>2. The first word of a chapter is generally printed in small
capitals, the first letter of the word being a large capital.</p>

<p>3. In handbills and advertisements, all important words
are capitalized, so as to attract special attention.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule IX.</span> <i>Titles of Persons.</i>—All titles of
respect or honor should be capitalized.</p>

<p>There are three classes of titles:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. Common Titles.</p>

<p class="in4">Mr., Mrs., Miss, Master.</p>

<p>2. Professional Titles.</p>

<p class="in4">Prof, Dr., D. D., LL. D., &amp;c.</p>

<p>3. Official Titles.</p>

<p class="in4">Hon., His Excellency, His Honor, President,
Secretary, Senator, Mr. Chairman, &amp;c.</p>

</div>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>President Hayes, Senator Morton, Hon. Thomas
W. Ferry, Dr. Chas. Rynd, Mr. Fred. J. Todd.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. A distinction should always be made between words used
as titles, and words used in a general sense. For example, senator
should commence with a small letter, if it is not placed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
before the name of a person as a title, or does not refer to a
particular individual. This is the same with president, secretary,
doctor, &amp;c.; as, “A patient owes some thanks to a
doctor who restores him with nectar smooth and fragrant,
instead of rasping his throat and flaying his interior with the
bitters sucked by sour-tempered roots from vixenish soils.”—<i>Winthrop.</i></p>

<p>2. Father, brother, sister, aunt, uncle, cousin, &amp;c., should
commence with a capital, when they are used like titles with
the names of persons; as, Father Pierce, Cousin Blackmar.</p>

<p>3. Sir, father, brother, friend, &amp;c., when used as introductory
words to a letter, should commence with capitals, as a
mark of respect; as, My dear Sir, My dear Friend.</p>

<p>4. In writing such titles as the President of the United
States, Secretary of State, Alexander the Great, all the
words in the title should commence with a capital, except
<i>of</i> and <i>the</i>.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule X.</span> <i>The Deity.</i>—All names of the Supreme
Being or his Son should commence with a
capital.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>“But it is now time to depart,—I to die, but
you to live. But which of us is going to the better
state is unknown to every one but God.”—<i>Socrates.</i></p>

<p>“For God so loved the world that he gave his
only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in
him should not perish but have everlasting life.”—<i>John
iii. 16.</i></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. Writers differ somewhat in the use of capitals in words
referring to the Deity. Some capitalize all words in any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
way referring to the Supreme Being, while others simply
capitalize the words that to them seem important. There
should be some uniformity in the use of capitals in words of
this character. As a general rule, it is better to follow the
usage of an authorized version of the Scriptures.</p>

<p>2. Such words as First Cause, First Principle, Almighty
God, Supreme Being, Lord God Almighty, Infinite One,
should always be written with capitals.</p>

<p>3. King of kings, Lord of lords, Son of man, Father of
lights, Father of spirits, God of hosts, Father of mercies,
Prince of life, Prince of kings, and expressions of a similar
character, should only commence with a capital. This is
the almost invariable usage of the Scriptures. These expressions
are not commonly used in the Bible as titles, in the
strict sense of the word. For example, King of kings really
means that the Deity is the supreme King of all human
kings. For illustration see 1 Tim. vi. 15; Dan. vii. 13; Jas.
i. 17; Heb. xii. 9; Psa. lxxx. 7; 2 Cor. i. 3; Acts iii. 15; Mat.
xii. 32. When these forms are used as titles, they may be
capitalized like titles.</p>

<p>4. The adjectives eternal, divine, heavenly, are not printed
with capitals in the Scriptures, when referring to the Deity;
as, the eternal God, heavenly Father. See Deut. xxxiii. 27;
Heb. ix. 14; Mat. vi. 32; 2 Pet. i. 3. When, however, these
adjectives are used in an emphatic or special sense, they may
commence with capitals.</p>

<p>5. The pronouns referring to the Deity should not be capitalized,
when they are used with some name of the Supreme
Being; as, “At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee,
O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid
these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed
them to babes.”—<i>Mat. xi. 25.</i> Any chapter of the New
Testament will give similar illustrations.</p>

<p>When, however, a pronoun referring to the Deity stands
alone, it should commence with a capital; as,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“O Thou! with whom the night is day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And one the near and far away.”—<i>Whittier.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>6. The capitalization of pronouns is sometimes carried to
a ridiculous excess by some writers, especially in poetry; as,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We praise Thee, O God! for the Son of Thy love.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>7. God, goddess, deity, applied to heathen divinities, should
not commence with a capital.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule XI.</span> <i>Quotations.</i>—When the exact words
of another are given, the first word of the quotation
should commence with a capital, if it forms a
complete sentence.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>“When the celebrated Chesterfield was asked by
a Parisian lady, ‘Why, my Lord, does England
still retain Christianity?’ ‘Madame,’ he replied,
with that mixture of repartee and philosophy
which met the case he was dealing with, ‘Madame,
because, as yet, we have been able to find nothing
better.’”</p>

<p>Fielding somewhere says, “A good face is a letter
of recommendation.”</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. When a quotation is introduced by <i>that</i>, it should not
commence with a capital; as, Napoleon banished Madame
de Stael because he said that “she carried a quiver of arrows
that could hit a man if he were seated on a rainbow.”</p>

<p>2. When only a part of a sentence is quoted, a small letter
should be used; as, “For what satisfaction hath a man,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
that he shall ‘lie down with kings and emperors in death,’
who in his lifetime never greatly coveted the society of such
bedfellows?”—<i>Lamb.</i></p>

<p>3. Sometimes a single word comprises the entire saying of
another. When this is so, it should commence with a capital;
as, “He shouted, ‘Victory.’”</p>

<p>4. When examples are given as illustrations of some general
principle, they naturally follow the same rule as quotations.
If an entire sentence is given as an example, it
should commence with a capital. When disconnected words
are given, small letters may be used, unless the words themselves
require capitals.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule XII.</span> <i>Resolutions.</i>—In writing resolutions,
the word immediately following <i>Resolved</i>,
should commence with a capital.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLE.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the Declaration, passed on the
fourth, be fairly engrossed on parchment, with the
title and style of ‘The Unanimous Declaration of
the Thirteen United States of America;’ and that
the same, when engrossed, be signed by every
member of Congress.”</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARK.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p><i>Resolved</i> commences with a capital in resolutions, and a
comma immediately precedes <i>That</i>.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule XIII.</span> <i>Special Words.</i>—Words used in
a special sense, or of special importance, commence
with capitals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>“As nowadays we build monuments to great
men, so in the Middle Ages they built shrines or
chapels on the spots which saints had made holy.”—<i>Froude.</i></p>

<p>“The Reformation broke the theological shackles
in which men’s minds were fettered.”—<i>Froude.</i></p>

<p>“That Popularity is alone valuable and enduring
which follows you, not that which you run after.”—<i>Lord
Mansfield.</i></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARK.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>Although it is the universal custom to capitalize a word
when used in a special sense to mark an important period or
event in history, there is another class of words to which
writers assign a special importance, the capitalization of
which must necessarily be left to the judgment and taste of
each writer. It should, however, be remembered that an
injudicious or too frequent use of capitals lessens their value
and force, and disfigures a written or printed page.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule XIV.</span> <i>Words Personified.</i>—When things
without life are represented as persons, they may
commence with capitals.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLE.</p>

<p>“Father Time is not always a hard parent, and
though he tarries for none of his children, he often
lays his hand lightly upon those who have used
him well; making them old men and women
inexorably enough, but leaving their hearts and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
spirits young and in full vigor. With such people
the gray head is but the impression of the old fellow’s
hand in giving them a blessing, and every
wrinkle but a notch in the quiet calendar of a
well-spent life.”—<i>Dickens.</i></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARK.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>Care should be taken not to carry this rule to an excess.
Unless the personification is vivid and emphatic, use small
letters; as,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule XV.</span> <i>I and O.</i>—The pronoun <i>I</i> and the

</div>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule XVI.</span> <i>References.</i>—In referring to passages

by capital letters.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>Irving’s “Life of Washington,” vol. III. p. 77.</p>

<p>Mommsen’s “History of Rome,” vol. IV. p. 18.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. Some commence volume and chapter with a capital,
but this is not the usual custom.</p>

<p>2. The volume, chapter, and page may be given, but the
volume and page are sufficient.</p>

<p>3. In referring to passages in the Bible, the chapter and
verse are given; as Luke, chap. ix. 15. It is the usual custom
to omit the word <i>chapter</i>, the letters representing the
chapter; and the number, the verse; as, “It may be fit to
remember that Moses, Lev. xi. 9, Deut. xiv. 9, appointed fish
to be the chief diet of the best commonwealth that ever yet
was.”—<i>Izaak Walton.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><span class="smcap">Rule XVII.</span> <i>Divisions of a Statement.</i>—When
a general statement is divided into separate and
distinct parts, it is better to commence each division
with a capital, even when they do not form complete
sentences, and are not separated from each
other by a period. This is especially the case
when the divisions are numbered.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">EXAMPLE.</p>

<p>“The history of the normal development of the
individual has its counterpart in the history of
humanity. There is, 1. The age of popular and
unconscious morality; 2. The transitional, skeptical,
or sophistical age; and 3. The philosophic or
conscious age of morality.”</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. When each division commences with a capital and is
also numbered, they will be more readily recognized and
understood.</p>

<p>2. Some writers number the divisions, but do not commence
them with capitals; as, “The teaching of composition
requires, (1) a cultivation of thought; and (2) a cultivation
of the faculty of expression.” It is better to commence each
division with a capital.</p>

<p>3. When a sentence is broken off to commence a new
line, in order to give special prominence to a statement, or
to attract attention, a capital should be used; as,—</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>In writing letters, or in preparing anything for
the press, care should be taken to write a plain,
readable hand. Many a valuable position has been
lost because of poor penmanship, and many worthy
productions have been thrown into the waste-basket,
because they have been poorly written.
Men of distinction can afford to write a poor hand,
to the inconvenience of friends, and the trouble of
printers, but, as a general rule, a poor writer labors
under a great disadvantage.</p>

<p>The following facts should be remembered in
writing letters:—</p>

<p>1. A letter should not be written on half a sheet
of paper, unless it is a business letter.</p>

<p>2. Business letters should be as brief as clearness
will permit.</p>

<p>3. It is never allowable to write across a written
page.</p>

<p>4. All unnecessary flourishes should be avoided.</p>

<p>5. Black ink is preferable, and it is more durable
than any other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<h3>THE ADDRESS.</h3>

<h4>INTRODUCTORY REMARK.</h4>

<p>The most important part of letter-writing is to
properly direct a letter. During the past year,
nearly 4,000,000 letters found their way to the
Dead Letter Office, 67,000 of which were misdirected.
When we consider the loss to business
firms in not promptly receiving important letters,
the anxiety to friends and relatives in the delay of
expected letters, the expense to the government in
sending them to the Dead Letter Office, and in
handling and returning them to the writers, the
proper direction of a letter becomes a matter of
very serious importance.</p>

<p class="rule"><i>Definition.</i>—The address consists of the title and
name of the person to whom the letter is written,
the city and the state in which he lives; as,—</p>

<div class="div-r">

<p class="noindent">Mr. William K. Bixby,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Houston,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Texas.</span></p>

</div>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. Care should be taken to write the address in a clear,
bold hand.</p>

<p>2. The usual titles are Mr., Mrs., Miss, and Master. The
last title is used in addressing a boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span></p>

<p>3. Esq. is sometimes placed after the name, instead of placing
Mr. before. It is used more especially with the names of
lawyers, artists, and men of social position. When Esq. is
used, never use Mr.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><i>Position.</i>—The title and name should be written
about the middle of the envelope, beginning on the
left. Below the title and name, and farther to the
right, should be written the city; below the city,
the state.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. It is customary to abbreviate the name of the state.
Great care, however, should be taken to properly abbreviate
the word. Some abbreviations are so similar to each other
that mistakes frequently arise:</p>

<p>2. The address should never be written diagonally.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><i>Punctuation.</i>—A comma should be placed after
the name of the person, and after the name of the
city. A period should be placed at the end.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. Mr., Mrs., Esq., Rev., Dr., Prof., Pres., Capt., &amp;c., are all
abbreviations, and consequently the abbreviations should be
indicated by a period. Miss is not an abbreviation, and thus
requires no mark after it. Messrs. is also an abbreviation.
It is used in addressing a firm, but it is frequently omitted.</p>

<p>2. If any part of a person’s name is abbreviated, a period
should always be used to indicate the abbreviation; as, John
S. C. Abbott. The S. and C. without a period really mean
nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<p>3. Some place a comma between the parts of a person’s
name. This, of course, is incorrect. See p. <a href="#Page_16">16</a> d.</p>

<p>4. All the words in the address should be capitalized, except
prepositions and articles.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><i>Honorary Titles.</i>—It is customary to give the
professional title or titles of the person to whom
a letter is directed, and if he occupies some responsible
position, this also should be indicated in the
address; as,—</p>

<div class="div-r">

<p class="noindent">Rev. E. O. Haven, D.D., LL.D.,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Chancellor of Syracuse University,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Syracuse,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">N. Y.</span></p>

</div>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. Honorary titles should be given for two reasons:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">(<i>a</i>) As a mark of respect.</p>

<p class="hanging">(<i>b</i>) The address will be more readily recognized by
postmasters, and the letter will be more likely to
reach its destination without delay.</p>

</div>

<p>2. When titles are written after a person’s name, a comma
should be placed after each title, for the reason that a comma
would be necessary, if the title was written out in full; as,
A. M., D.D., LL.D.</p>

<p>3. Some writers make the mistake of placing a period after
the first L in LL.D. This title stands for Doctor of Laws,
the LL. indicating the plural of Law. As the two letters
stand for one word, the period must necessarily be placed
after the second L.</p>

<p>4. Hon. applies to judges, senators, representatives, heads
of government departments, mayors, and others of similar
rank; as, Hon. Thomas M. Cooley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<p>5. His Excellency applies to the President of the United
States, an Ambassador of the United States, or the Governor
of a State. This title should be written on a line by
itself; as,—</p>

<div class="div-r">

<p class="noindent">His Excellency,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Gov. C. M. Croswell,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Adrian,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Mich.</span></p>

</div>

<p>6. In addressing a married lady, the professional title of
her husband is sometimes used; as, Mrs. Dr. Haven.</p>

<p>7. Two professional titles meaning the same thing should
never be used; as, Dr. A. D. Smith, M. D.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><i>Large Cities.</i>—When the person to whom the
letter is addressed, lives in a large city where letters
are delivered at places of business or private
residences, the title and name, number of house and
street, the city, and state should be given; as,—</p>

<div class="div-r">

<p class="noindent">A. S. Barnes &amp; Co.,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">34 and 36 Madison St.,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Chicago.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Ill.</span></p>

</div>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. The title and name should be written first, the number
and street to the right and a little below, the city below the
name of the street, and the state under the city.</p>

<p>2. The name of the state might be omitted in the address
above given. It is not really necessary to give the state,
when the city is so widely known that no mistake can arise,
if the name of the state is omitted; as, New York, Philadelphia,
Boston.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p class="rule"><i>Small Towns and Villages.</i>—The name of the
county in which a small town or village is located,
should always be given in the address. If the person
to whom the letter is written, lives in the country,
the nearest post-office must be given, together
with the county and state. The name of the place
in which a person lives, and his post-office address,
may be two very different things.</p>

<div class="div-r">

<p class="noindent">Mr. George Harvey,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Palmyra,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Lenawee Co.,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Mich.</span></p>

</div>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. The title and name should be written first; the town,
village, or post-office, second; the county, third; the state
last.</p>

<p>2. Sometimes letters are detained at post-offices, by reason
of the directions not being sufficiently complete.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><i>Addressed Envelopes.</i>—It is the custom with
business firms, when an answer to a letter is asked
as a favor, to send, within the letter, a stamped envelope
properly addressed. The address is usually
printed, so that no mistake can be made. In all
cases, even when an addressed envelope is not required,
when a favor is asked from an acquaintance
or a friend, and an answer is desired, a postage stamp
should always be inclosed. It is certainly an unpardonable
presumption to ask even a friend to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
write a letter for a particular purpose, and expect
him to pay for its proper delivery.</p>

<p class="rule"><i>Letters with Special Request.</i>—Sometimes directions
are written or printed on envelopes as to the
disposal of letters, if not called for within a certain
time. This should always be done when addressing
business letters. These directions are written
or printed on the left of the envelope, near the top.
See form on p. <a href="#Page_81">81</a>.</p>

<p class="rule"><i>The Stamp.</i>—The stamp should be placed in the
right-hand corner of the envelope, near the top. It
seems hardly necessary to say that every letter
should be properly stamped, and yet between three
and four hundred thousand letters are annually sent
to the Dead Letter Office, because the writers had
forgotten to properly stamp them.</p>

<h4>I. THE HEADING.</h4>

<p class="rule"><i>Definition.</i>—The heading consists of the name
of the city in which the writer lives, the state, the
month, the day of the month, and the year; as,—</p>

<div class="letter">

<p class="heading">Adrian, Mich., Nov. 6, 1877.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. Great care should always be taken to give in the heading,
not only the city, but also the state. If the letter should
be sent to the Dead Letter Office, the heading will properly
indicate the place to which the letter is to be returned.</p>

<p>2. The heading indicates to the person who receives the
letter where an answer is to be sent.</p>

<p>3. Sometimes the day of the week is given; as, Adrian,
Monday, Nov. 5, 1877.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><i>Punctuation.</i>—A comma should be placed after
the city, state, and date. A period should be
placed at the end. If a word is abbreviated, a
period should be used to indicate the abbreviation,
and a comma should also be used, if the word written
out in full would require a comma; as,—</p>

<ul>
<li>Adrian, Michigan, November 6, 1877.</li>
<li>Adrian, Mich., Nov. 6, 1877.</li>
</ul>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. Some writers thoughtlessly place a comma between the
name of the month and the day of the month; as, November,
6, or Nov., 6. The 6 forms an essential part of the
month, and should not be separated from it by a punctuation
mark.</p>

<p>2. It is better to omit <i>st</i>, <i>th</i>, or <i>d</i> after the number indicating
the day of the month. It certainly looks neater to write
the date without the marks and dots that sometimes disfigure
the heading of letters.</p>

<p>3. Some prefer to place the number before the name of
the month; as, Adrian, Mich., 6 Nov., 1877. This, however,
is not the usual practice.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<p class="rule"><i>Large Cities.</i>—In large cities where letters are
delivered by letter-carriers, it is necessary to give,
in the heading of a letter, the number of the house
and the name of the street. The order should be
number, street, city, state, month, day of the month,
year; as,—</p>

<div class="letter">

<p class="heading">215 Prospect St., Cleveland, Ohio,<br>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">March 5, 1877.</span></p>

</div>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. Sometimes the size of the paper necessitates the use of
three lines for the heading. If this should be necessary, the
number of the house and the name of the street should be
on the first line; the city and state, on the second; the
month, the day of the month, and year, on the third. Each
line should commence farther to the right than the preceding;
as,—</p>

<div class="letter">

<p class="heading"><span style="margin-right: 4em;">215 Prospect St.,</span><br>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Cleveland, Ohio,</span><br>
March 5, 1877.</p>

</div>

<p>2. As few lines as possible should be used in the heading.
In sending letters from well known cities like New York,
Philadelphia, &amp;c., it is not necessary to give the state. When
the name of the state is omitted, the heading can usually be
written on two lines.</p>

<p>3. A period should be placed after St., because it is an
abbreviation. A comma should also follow the period, because
the word written in full would require a comma. 215
Prospect St., is one item; Cleveland, a second; Ohio, a third;
March 5, a fourth; 1877, a fifth.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p class="rule"><i>A Small Town or Village.</i>—If the place in
which the writer lives, is a small town or village,
the name of the place, county, and state should be
given; as,—</p>

<div class="letter">

<p class="heading">Palmyra, Lenawee Co., Mich.,<br>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Sept. 13, 1877.</span></p>

</div>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. The county should be given so that an answer to the
letter may be properly directed.</p>

<p>2. If the writer lives in the country, the post-office where
his letters are received, should be given, and not the place
where he lives.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><i>Hotels.</i>—When a letter is written at some prominent
hotel, it is customary to give the name of the
hotel in the heading; as,—</p>

<div class="letter">

<p class="heading">Grand Central Hotel, New York,<br>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Jan. 10, 1877.</span></p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><i>Seminaries and Colleges.</i>—In writing from a
seminary, college, or university, the name of the
institution is sometimes given; as,—</p>

<div class="letter">

<p class="heading">Female Seminary, Cleveland, Ohio,<br>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">April 11, 1877.</span></p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><i>Position.</i>—The heading should be written on the
first line, on the right hand, commencing about the
middle of the line. If more than one line is required,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
the second line should commence farther to
the right than the first, and the third than the
second.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. When a letter does not fill a full page, the heading
should not be written on the first line. The space at the
head of the letter should be about the same as at the bottom.
In business letters, this is not necessary.</p>

<p>2. Some write the city, state, month, &amp;c., at the close of a
letter. This is not however, the usual form.</p>

</div>

<h4>II. THE ADDRESS.</h4>

<p class="rule"><i>Definition.</i>—The address in the inside of a letter
should be the same as the address on the envelope.
It consists of the title and name of the person to
whom the letter is written, and the place of his residence;
as,—</p>

<div class="letter">

<p class="address">Mr. William K. Bixby,<br>
Houston, Texas.</p>

</div>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>There are several reasons why the address should be written
within the letter:—</p>

<p>1. Business men usually take an impression or make a
copy of all letters written by themselves or their agents. It
is a great convenience to have the address within the letter,
so that it can be referred to, if necessary, at any time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<p>2. If the envelope is accidentally torn off, or is lost by not
being properly sealed, the letter can still be forwarded to its
destination, if the address is written within.</p>

<p>3. It is frequently the habit, on receiving a letter, to destroy
the envelope. Sometimes, after the envelope is destroyed,
the letter is lost. If there is an inside address, the
letter, if found, can be returned.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><i>Punctuation.</i>—A comma should be placed after
the name of the person and of the city. A period
should be placed at the end.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. By placing <i>to</i> before the address, it will be seen that a
period is required at its close, just as a period is required at
the end of the address on the envelope; as, To William K.
Bixby, Houston, Texas.</p>

<p>2. Some writers place a colon after the name of the state,
but the practice is not a correct one. A semicolon should
never be used.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><i>Large Cities.</i> When the person to whom the letter
is written, lives in a large city, the number and
name of the street should be given, as on the outside
address; as,—</p>

<div class="letter">

<p class="address">A. S. Barnes &amp; Co.,<br>
34 and 36 Madison St., Chicago.</p>

</div>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARK.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>If three lines are necessary, the title and name should be
on the first line, the number and street on the second, the
city and state on the third.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span></p>

<p class="rule"><i>Small Towns and Villages.</i>—When the letter
is addressed to a small town or village, the county
in which the town or village is situated, should be
given; as,—</p>

<div class="letter">

<p class="address">Mr. George Harvey,<br>
Palmyra, Lenawee Co., Mich.</p>

</div>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARK.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>The title and name should be on one line; the town or
village, county, and state should be on the second.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><i>Letters to Intimate Friends or Relatives.</i>—In writing
letters to intimate friends or relatives, the address
should be written at the close of the letter, at the
left, commencing on the line immediately following
the signature. It would be too formal to write
the address at the head of the letter, and it would
not be in keeping with the introductory words
which immediately follow; as,—</p>

<div class="letter">

<p class="heading">Milburn Wagon Works, Toledo, Ohio,<br>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Nov. 2, 1877.</span></p>

<p class="conclusion"><span style="margin-right: 2em;">Very affectionately,</span><br>
Edgar W. Curtis.</p>

<p class="address">Mrs. James E. Curtis,<br>
Adrian, Mich.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARK.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>When the heading occupies only one line, it is better to
leave a blank line between the heading and the address.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><i>Position.</i>—The address should commence on the
left, and should be written on, at least, two lines.
The title and name should be on one line; the city
and state, on the second, and farther to the right.
The address, if possible, should be written on two
lines. If the heading consists of two or three lines,
the address should commence on the line immediately
following the heading. If the heading consists of
one line only, a blank line should be left between
the heading and the address.</p>

<h4>III. INTRODUCTORY WORDS.</h4>

<p class="rule"><i>Definition.</i>—The introductory words consist of
the greeting or salutation; as,—</p>

<div class="letter">

<p class="intro">Dear Sir,—</p>

</div>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. Sometimes only one word is used in the greeting; as,
Sir, Gentlemen.</p>

<p>2. When Sir, Gentlemen, Friend, Father, &amp;c., are used as
introductory words, they should always commence with a
capital, as a mark of respect. In greeting friends or relatives,
do not belittle them with small letters.</p>

<p>3. When dear, respected, honored, and words of a like
character, are not the first words of the salutation, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
should commence with a small letter; as, My dear Sir, My
respected Friend. If they commence the salutation, capitals
should be used; as, Dear Father, Respected Friend.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><i>Punctuation.</i>—A comma should be placed after
the salutation, and a dash may also be used. The
use of the dash, however, is simply a matter of
taste.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. A colon should not be placed after the greeting, except
in official or very formal salutations. See p. <a href="#Page_100">100</a>.</p>

<p>2. A semicolon should never be used.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><i>Position.</i>—The introductory words may be written
in three different positions:—</p>

<p>1. When the address occupies two lines, the salutation
should be written on the line immediately
following, commencing a little to the right of the
second line of the address; as,</p>

<div class="letter">

<p class="address">Mr. Harry B. Hutchins,<br>
Mt. Clemens, Mich.</p>

<p class="intro">Dear Sir,—</p>

</div>

<p>2. If the address consists of three lines, the first
word of the salutation commences on a line with
the number of the street; as,—</p>

<div class="letter">

<p class="address"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">A. S. Barnes &amp; Co.,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">34 and 36 Madison St.,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Chicago.</span></p>

<p class="intro">Gentlemen,—</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>3. If the address is written at the close of the
letter, the introductory words should commence on
a line with the body of the letter, that is, with the
marginal line; as,—</p>

<div class="letter">

<p>Dear Manning,—</p>

<p class="body">Rest you merry in your own opinion.
Opinion is a species of property; and though
I am always desirous to share with my friend to
a certain extent, I shall ever like to keep some
tenets, and some property, properly my own. <span class="ditto1">*</span>
<span class="ditto1">*</span> <span class="ditto1">*</span>
<span class="ditto1">*</span> <span class="ditto1">*</span></p>

<p class="conclusion">Your well-wisher and friend,<br>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">C. Lamb.</span></p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><i>Forms of Salutation.</i>—Custom authorizes the
use of several forms of salutation. These may
be arranged under four heads:—</p>

<p>1. <i>To Strangers.</i></p>

<p class="in4">Sir, Madame, Miss ⸺.</p>

<p>2. <i>To Acquaintances.</i></p>

<p class="in4">Dear Sir, Dear Madame, Dear Miss ⸺.</p>

<h4>IV. BODY OF THE LETTER.</h4>

<p class="rule"><i>The First Word.</i>—The first word should commence
on the line immediately following the introductory<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
words, and directly under the comma or
the dash of the salutation; as,—</p>

<div class="letter">

<p class="intro">Dear Sir,—</p>

<p class="body">Your letter <span class="ditto1">*</span> <span class="ditto1">*</span> 
<span class="ditto1">*</span> <span class="ditto1">*</span></p>

</div>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARK.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>Some writers commence the body of the letter on the
same line with the greeting.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><i>Margin.</i>—It is the usual custom to leave a margin
on the left of a written page. This varies
according to the taste of the writer and the size of
the page.</p>

<p class="rule"><i>Paragraphs.</i>—A new paragraph should commence
whenever a new subject is introduced, and,
with the exception of the first paragraph, which
begins directly under the comma or the dash of the
salutation, each paragraph should commence a little
to the right of the marginal line.</p>

<h4>V. THE CONCLUSION.</h4>

<p class="rule"><i>Definition.</i>—The conclusion is made up of two
parts,—words of respect or affection, and the signature
of the writer; as,—</p>

<div class="letter">

<p class="conclusion"><span style="margin-right: 6em;">Very truly,</span><br>
Joseph M. Blain.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span></p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. Various forms of respect or affection are used in concluding
letters; as, Respectfully, Most respectfully, Very
affectionately, &amp;c.</p>

<p>2. In using words of respect or affection, the first word
only should be capitalized. In the salutation, Sir, Friend,
&amp;c., should commence with a capital, as a mark of respect;
but in the conclusion of a letter, it would, to say the least,
be in bad taste to give the same prominence to one’s own
worth.</p>

<p>3. The conclusion should always be in keeping with the
introductory words. If Sir were used in the salutation, it
would not be proper to use Very affectionately at the close.</p>

<p>4. Although custom sanctions the use of Your obedient
servant, Your most obedient servant, and similar forms, the
practice is not to be commended. These expressions are
associated with a past age, when men depended on the
uncertain patronage of the great.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule"><i>Punctuation.</i>—A comma should be placed after
the words of respect and affection, and a period
should be placed at the end of the signature.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARK.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>There is great carelessness exhibited by all writers in
punctuating their names. A period should always be placed
at the end of the signature, to indicate that the signature is
complete. If the different parts of the name are written out
in full, no punctuation marks should be placed between
them; if, however, any part of the name is abbreviated, a
period should always be used to indicate the abbreviation;
as, Ettie Shier, Laura B. Palmer, Geo. L. Bennett.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span></p>

<p class="rule"><i>Position.</i>—The conclusion should be written on,
at least, two lines. The words of respect and
affection should be written on the line immediately
following the close of the letter, on the right, commencing
near the middle of the line; the signature
should be on the line immediately following the
words of respect and affection, a little farther to
the right.</p>

<p class="rule"><i>The Signature.</i>—In signing one’s name, there
are several important facts to be remembered:—</p>

<p>1. The writer’s full name should always be given,
especially in business letters and in letters containing
money, so that the letter can be returned, if, for
any reason, it is sent to the Dead Letter Office.
This, of course, can not be done unless the writer’s
name is given in full. Thousands of dollars are
lost every year by writers thoughtlessly signing
themselves Nellie, Fred., &amp;c. 25,000 letters, containing
$1,301,780, were sent to the Dead Letter
Office in the year 1877.</p>

<p>2. A lady, in writing to a stranger, should always
sign her name so that the person receiving the letter
will know, in answering, whether to address a
single or a married lady; as, Miss Maria S. Colvin,
Mrs. David Finley.</p>

<p>3. It is frequently the custom for married ladies
to use their husband’s name; as, Mrs. E. B. Pond.
Widow ladies use their Christian name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span></p>

<p>4. If the person writing a letter to a stranger,
occupies a responsible or official position, he should
give this in connection with his signature, so that
the person to whom the letter is written, may have
some means of knowing how much attention to
give to the letter.</p>

</div>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>Most business men, and all professional men,
have occasion, more or less, to have something
printed for their own use, or to write something for
the public press, so that a correct knowledge of
some of the simpler marks used by proof-readers,
in making corrections and additions, seems imperative.
The advice sometimes given to allow the
printer to make all corrections, since he is more
likely to know what corrections are necessary, is
destructive to a clear presentation of what another
has written. The printer may understand better
than the writer the mechanical part of his work,
but “mind reading” has not yet reached such perfection
that the compositor can tell, in all instances,
what meaning the writer really wishes to convey,
and a misconception on the part of the printer may
be the means of changing the sense of a whole
paragraph.</p>

<p>In preparing anything for the press, a few facts
should be remembered:—</p>

<p>1. It is never allowable to write on both sides of
a sheet of paper. Only one side should be used,
and each page should be properly numbered.</p>

<p>2. The manuscript should be prepared with great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
care. It should be properly punctuated, capitalized,
and broken into paragraphs. In fact, the
copy placed in the hands of the printer should be
in a condition to be exactly reproduced. Some
expect the printer to dress up in proper form their
half expressed, poorly written, and badly punctuated
sentences, and if their hieroglyphics and abbreviations
are not deciphered to suit their unreasonable
expectations, they rail against incompetent
printers and blundering proof-readers.</p>

<p>3. Some writers thoughtlessly leave many points
unsettled in the manuscript, so as to see “how they
look in print,” then fill the proof with numberless
corrections and additions, and expect the printer to
make such changes as the impulse of the moment
has suggested. This is certainly a great injustice
to the compositor, who usually receives no remuneration
for this additional tax on his time and
patience. No half finished manuscript ought to be
allowed to go into the printer’s hand.</p>

<p>4. Whenever it is really necessary to strike out
several words, enough words should be substituted
in their places to fill the vacant spaces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<h3>DEFINITIONS.</h3>

<p><i>Copy.</i>—This word really means something to be
imitated, and it is used by printers when referring
to the manuscript of a writer.</p>

<p><i>Proof-Sheet.</i>—When the copy is set up in type,
an impression in ink is taken for corrections. This
is called a proof-sheet. In correcting proof, the
first thing to be done is to place the copy in the
hands of some one to read aloud, while the proof-reader
pays attention principally to omissions, the
spelling and capitalization of words, and punctuation.
After this, the proof should be carefully
examined to detect what are called typographical
errors, that is, mistakes in type.</p>

<p><i>Revise.</i>—After the corrections indicated in the
proof are made, another impression is taken. This
is called the revise. The revise should be carefully
compared with the proof, to see that all corrections
are made.</p>

<h4>INTRODUCTORY REMARK.</h4>

<p>Mistakes in the proof should be called attention
to by certain marks which will hereafter be described,
and the corrections should be indicated in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
the margin, on the right or left of the line in which
they occur. If mistakes are found near the beginning
of the line, the corrections should be placed
in the margin on the left, otherwise they should be
placed on the right. The numbers in the following
statements refer to lines of the specimen proof-sheet
on pages <a href="#illus22">111</a>, <a href="#illus23">112</a>.</p>

<p class="rule">I. <i>Wrong Letters and Punctuation Marks.</i>—The
most common mistakes in a proof-sheet are
wrong letters and punctuation marks. When these
are noticed, a line should be drawn slopingly, from
right to left, through each, and the correct letter or
punctuation mark written in the margin. It is better
to repeat the line with the correction in the
margin, so as to attract attention to the desired
change; as, 2, 4, 8. A sloping line should always
be placed between corrections opposite the same
line, and the corrections should be placed in the
order in which they occur.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. The correction in the margin should always be placed
to the left of the sloping line; as, 2, 3, 4, 8.</p>

<p>2. The period, dash, hyphen, quotation marks, apostrophe,
and reference marks should be distinguished in the
margin, thus:—</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus21" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus21.jpg" alt=" ">
</figure>

<p>For illustrations, see 6, 10.</p>

<p>3. If it is necessary to change a capital letter to a small
letter, draw a line through the capital, and either write a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
small letter in the margin, or the abbreviation <i>l.c.</i>, lower
case, which indicates that a common letter is to be used;
as, 3.</p>

<p>4. The abbreviation <i>w.f.</i>, wrong font, indicates that a letter
is of improper size.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule">II. <i>Wrong Words.</i>—When an entire word is
incorrect, a straight line should be drawn through it,
and the proper word written in the margin; as, 5.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARK.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>When it is necessary to change a word, printed in capitals,
to small letters, draw a line through the word, and write <i>l.c.</i>
in the margin; as, 16. See I., Rem. 3.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule">III. <i>Omissions.</i>—If a letter, punctuation mark,
or word is omitted, the omission should be indicated
by a caret, and the omitted letter, punctuation mark,
or word placed in the margin; as, 3, 6.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. When the period, dash, hyphen, quotation marks, or
reference marks are omitted, they should be distinguished
in the margin as in I., Rem. 2.</p>

<p>2. A sloping line should always be made in the margin,
to the right of an omitted letter or punctuation mark; as, 3.</p>

<p>3. If several words or lines are omitted, it is sometimes
necessary to write the words at the top or bottom of the
proof. When this is the case, a line should be drawn from
the caret to the words to be inserted; as, 25.</p>

<p>4. Sometimes so much has been omitted that it is necessary
to refer to the copy. When this is so, indicate the
omission by a caret, write <i>See Copy</i> in the margin, and inclose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
within parenthetical marks or brackets the portion of the
copy to be inserted in the proof.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule">IV. <i>Inverted Letter.</i>—When a letter is inverted,
a sloping line should be drawn through it, and the
change indicated in the margin by 9, a character
resembling an inverted 6; as, 13.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARK.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>Some proof-readers draw a line under the inverted letter,
but this is not so easily recognized as a sloping line drawn
through the letter.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule">V. <i>Strike Out.</i>—It is sometimes necessary to
strike out a letter, punctuation mark, or word. A
line should be drawn through each, as in I. and II.,
and the sign ₰, which means strike out, placed in
the margin; as, 9, 19.</p>

<p class="rule">VI. <i>Capitals and Italics.</i>—Three lines drawn
under a word indicate that the word should be
printed in large capitals; two lines, small capitals;
one line, italics. The abbreviations, <i>Caps.</i>, <i>S.
Caps.</i>, <i>Ital.</i>, should also be written in the margin;
as, 1, 2.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. If a word is italicized, and it is desirable to change it to
the ordinary type, draw a line under it, and write <i>Rom.</i>, the
abbreviation for Roman, in the margin; as, 15.</p>

<p>2. To change a word printed in capitals to small letters,
see II., Rem.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p class="rule">VII. <i>Spacing.</i>—When there is too great a space
between two letters, the letters should be connected
by the marks ⁐, and the same sign should be
repeated in the margin; as, 21. The single mark
‿ connecting two words and repeated in the margin,
indicates too great a space between words;
as, 23.</p>

<p>When there is not sufficient space between two
words, a caret is used to indicate the want of space,
and the sign # written in the margin; as, 25.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. When there is not space enough between two lines, or
there is too much, the fact can be indicated as in 7 and 8, 13
and 14.</p>

<p>2. When a space is not left at the commencement of a
paragraph, a caret indicates the want of space, and the
sign ▭ is placed in the margin; as, 17.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule">VIII. <i>Paragraphs.</i>—When a new paragraph is
desired, the sign [ should be inserted in the proof,
before the first word of the new paragraph, and
the sign ¶ should be placed in the margin; as, 10.</p>

<p>When two paragraphs are to be run together,
they should be connected by a line, and <i>No</i> ¶ written
in the margin; as, 24.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. The line connecting the two paragraphs is usually so
readily recognized that an additional sign in the margin is
not always required.</p>

<p>2. For space at the commencement of a paragraph, see
VII., Rem. 2.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p class="rule">IX. <i>Correction to be Disregarded.</i>—Dots placed
under a word, and <i>Stet.</i>, which means let it stand,
written in the margin, indicate that a correction is
to be disregarded; as, 25.</p>

<p class="rule">X. <i>Broken Letters.</i>—When it is necessary to
call the attention of the printer to a broken letter,
a line should be drawn under it, and the sign ×
placed in the margin; as, 21.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARK.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>It is the custom with some proof-readers to draw a sloping
line through the broken letter, and repeat the letter in
the margin. This is sometimes a great convenience to the
printer, especially when the letter is so badly injured that it
can not be recognized; for, unless the printer is familiar
with the spelling of the word, it may be necessary, with
considerable inconvenience, to refer to the copy.</p>

</div>

<p class="rule">XI. <i>Transpose.</i>—When two words should change
places, the custom is to draw a line over the first,
continue it under the second, and write <i>tr.</i>, the
abbreviation for transpose, in the margin; as, 26.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">REMARKS.</p>

<div class="remarks">

<p>1. When several letters in a word are not in their proper
order, either draw a line through the word and rewrite it in
the margin, or draw a line under or through the letters, and
write them in their proper order.</p>

<p>2. When the order of several words is to be changed, indicate
the proper order by placing 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c., over the
words, draw a straight line under each, and write <i>tr.</i> in the
margin.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p class="rule">XII. <i>Crooked Words.</i>—When the letters of a
word are displaced, draw a line above and below
the word, and repeat the lines in the margin; as,
28. The same marks are used to call attention to
a crooked line.</p>

<p class="rule">XIII. <i>Projecting Leads.</i>—When a lead projects
so as to leave an impression on the proof, a
sloping line should be drawn through it, and the
sign [symbol] or [symbol] placed in the margin; as, 22.</p>

<p class="rule">XIV. <i>Diphthongs.</i>—When <i>æ</i> and <i>œ</i> should be
printed as diphthongs, a line should be drawn
through them, and the letters forming the diphthong
written in the margin thus, æ̑, œ̑.</p>

<p class="rule">XV. <i>Mark of Attention.</i>—The sign + is sometimes
used to call the attention of the printer to
some defect in a word or line.</p>

<h4>GENERAL REMARK.</h4>

<p>It is the custom with many proof-readers to draw
a line from the mistake in the proof to the correction
in the margin. This should always be done
when the mistakes are numerous, or the lines
crowded together.</p>

<h3>DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.</h3>

<p>Ye who listen with credulity to the
whispers of fancy, and pursue with
eagerness the phantoms of hope;
who expect that age will perform the
promises of youth, and that the deficiencies
of the present day will be
supplied by the morrow, attend to
the history of Rasselas, prince of
Abyssinia.</p>

<p>Rasselas was the fourth son of the
mighty emperor, in whose dominions
the father of waters begins his
course; whose bounty pours down
the streams of plenty, and scatters
over half the world the harvests of
Egypt.</p>

<p>The place which the wisdom or
policy of antiquity had destined for
the residence of the Abyssinian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
princes, was a spacious valley in the
kingdom of Amhara, surrounded on
every side by mountains, of which
the summits overhung the middle
part. The only passage by which
it could be entered, was a cavern
that passed under a rock, of which
it has long been disputed whether it
was the work of nature or of human
industry.</p>
